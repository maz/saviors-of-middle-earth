Saviors of Middle Earth
=======================

A [Hardcode 2013] [1] project. Originally posted at http://saviors-of-middle-earth.googlecode.com/

To start the development server, ensure that the appengine SDK commands have been properly symlinked to your `PATH`, and then run `ruby dev_server.rb`. Running the `asset-watch.sh` script will startup SASS and Coffee-Script compilers, which listen for changes on assets.
